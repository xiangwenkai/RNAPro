### Setting up kernels
> **Highlight:**  
> RNAPro kernel setup (custom CUDA kernels, triangle attention/multiplicative, etc.) follows the configuration from Protenix.  
> Most acceleration options and installation steps are the same or compatible with Protenix.  
> ⚡ The guide below is an explanation from the Protenix documentation.
- **Custom CUDA layernorm kernels** modified from [FastFold](https://github.com/hpcaitech/FastFold) and [Oneflow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow) accelerate about 30%-50% during different training stages. To use this feature, run the following command:
  ```bash
  export LAYERNORM_TYPE=fast_layernorm
  ```
  If the environment variable `LAYERNORM_TYPE` is set to `fast_layernorm`, the model will employ the layernorm we have developed; otherwise, the naive PyTorch layernorm will be adopted. The kernels will be compiled when `fast_layernorm` is called for the first time.
- **Triangle_attention Kernel Options**
  The model supports four implementations for triangle attention, configurable in [configs_base.py](../configs/configs_base.py):
  ```python
  triangle_attention = "cuequivariance"  # or "triattention"/"deepspeed"/"torch"
  ```
  1. **cuEquivariance Kernel(Default)**
      Optimized implementation using NVIDIA's [cuEquivariance](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuEquivariance) library.
  

  2. **TriAttention kernel**

      Custom kernel implementation from [rnapro/model/tri_attention/](../rnapro/model/tri_attention/)

  
  3. **[DeepSpeed DS4Sci_EvoformerAttention kernel](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/ds4sci_evoformerattention/)** is a memory-efficient attention kernel developed as part of a collaboration between OpenFold and the DeepSpeed4Science initiative.

      DS4Sci_EvoformerAttention is implemented based on [CUTLASS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass). If you use this feature, You need to clone the CUTLASS repository and specify the path to it in the environment variable CUTLASS_PATH. The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) has already include this setting:
      ```bash
      RUN git clone -b v3.5.1 https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass.git  /opt/cutlass
      ENV CUTLASS_PATH=/opt/cutlass
      ```
      If you set up `RNAPro` by `pip`, you can set environment variable `CUTLASS_PATH` as follows:

      ```bash
      git clone -b v3.5.1 https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass.git  /path/to/cutlass
      export CUTLASS_PATH=/path/to/cutlass
      ```

      The kernels will be compiled when DS4Sci_EvoformerAttention is called for the first time.

- **Triangle_multiplicative Kernel Options**
    
    The Triangle Multiplicative operation supports two implementations,Configuration configurable in [configs_base.py](../configs/configs_base.py):
    ```python
    triangle_multiplicative = "cuequivariance"  # or "torch"
    ```

    1. cuEquivariance Kernel (Default)
    Optimized implementation using NVIDIA's [cuEquivariance](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuEquivariance) library.

    2. Torch Native
    Standard PyTorch implementation.
