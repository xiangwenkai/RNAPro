Intended Task/Domain:                                                                   |  RNA 3D structure prediction

Describe how the model works:                                                                          |  This model takes an RNA sequence as input, then first constructs input features through an input embedding layer. The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and template information associated with the sequence are each processed by an MSA encoder and a template encoder to be transformed into features. In addition, single and pairwise features are computed using a pretrained RNA foundation model, after which a pairformer module produces the updated single and pair representations. Finally, the 3D structure is predicted from these representations through a diffusion module.
Name the adversely impacted groups this has been tested to deliver comparable outcomes regardless of:  |  Not Applicable
Technical Limitations & Mitigation:                                                                    |  The model was trained on cropped sequences, so it may show reduced accuracy when applied to long RNA sequences. This model is highly sensitive to the quality of the templates. If no appropriate templates are found by the template search procedure, its prediction accuracy may decrease.
Verified to have met prescribed NVIDIA quality standards:  |  Yes
Performance Metrics:                                                                                   | Alpha-carbon only TM-score (Template Modeling score)
Potential Known Risks:                                                                                 |  If the model does not work as intended, it may generate inaccurate predictions for some RNA biological sequences, which can mislead the interpretation of their mechanisms, binding sites, or functions. In the context of drug and therapeutic development, such erroneous structures can also misguide target pocket identification and interaction modeling, leading to inefficient optimization efforts.
