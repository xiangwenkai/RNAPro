Model Application Field(s):                               |  Drug discovery/Biology
Describe the life critical impact (if present).   |  Experimental drug discovery and medicine: Additional in silico and in vitro tests are recommended before using the predicted structures for downstream applications.<br>
Use Case Restrictions:                              |  Abide by the [NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/enterprise-software/nvidia-open-model-license/).
Model and dataset restrictions:            |  The Principle of least privilege (PoLP) is applied limiting access for dataset generation and model development.  Restrictions enforce dataset access during training, and dataset license constraints adhered to.
